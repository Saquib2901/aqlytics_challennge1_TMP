üîç Key Insights & Findings
Our analysis of the OmniMart dataset led to the following key insights:

Insight 1: Customers are clearly split into two major groups: 'High-Value Champions' who spend 2.5 times more on average, and a large group of 'At-Risk' customers who are lapsing.

Insight 2: Electronics and Grocery are the primary drivers of sales volume, significantly outpacing all other product categories.

Insight 3: The chosen shipping method has no discernible impact on the final order status, indicating a consistent and reliable backend fulfillment process.

üí° Strategic Recommendations

Based on our findings, we propose the following targeted strategies:

For High-Value Champions (Nurture & Reward):

Loyalty Program: Implement a tiered rewards system with exclusive perks like early access to sales and free shipping.

Personalized Campaigns: Leverage purchase history to offer tailored recommendations and upsell opportunities.

Community Building: Engage these customers for feedback and encourage them to become brand advocates.

For At--Risk / Lapsed Customers (Re-engage & Win Back):

Win-Back Campaigns: Launch targeted "We Miss You!" emails with compelling discounts to incentivize a return purchase.

New Product Highlights: Notify them about new arrivals in their previously preferred categories to rekindle interest.

Feedback Surveys: Deploy surveys to understand their reasons for inactivity and gather data for future improvements.
